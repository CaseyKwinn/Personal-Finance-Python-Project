# Personal-Finance-Python-Project

This is a project I worked on with the guidance of a youtube video by Lore So What.

For this project I use gpsread to connect a specific sheet from my google drive to my Jupyter Notebook. This sheet includes data downloaded from my bank statements. Then I make use of pandas and NumPy to organize and clean the data, as well as HoloViews and Panel to build an interactive dashboard to track my finances.  

The interactive dashboard includes:  
- Input windows for income, recurring expenses, non-recurring expenses, and savings
- A chart for last month expenses, organized and sorted by category of expense
- A chart and table showing data on the selected category of expense in the dropdown menu
  - This includes date, amount, and details provided by bank statment
